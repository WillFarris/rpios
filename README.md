# A simple Raspberry Pi 3 """Operating System"""

A combination of Sergey Matyukevich's [Raspberry Pi OS tutorials](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os) and Low Level Devel's [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRWXAQsN5S3FPDHY4Ttq1Xg). End goal is to learn some aarch64 assembly and bare-metal programming on ARM devices.

This isn't really intended for anything usable. I'm just interested in the inner workings of computer hardware and this seems like a good way to learn. Feel free to copy/modify this code, but make sure you give credit to the aforementioned tutorials. Their code is probably higher quality anyway :)
